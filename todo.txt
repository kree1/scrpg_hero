Make column-display routines adjust number of columns based on width?
 Max length of a canon Power is 20 (Lightning Calculator)
 Max length of a canon Quality is 24 (Criminal Underworld Info)

 Linear regression:
  buffer = 0.432692 * width - 19.7596
 Quadratic regression:
  buffer = -0.00201007 * width^2 + 0.907185 * width - 46.6979
 Entered as:
  buffer = math.floor(0.43 * width - 20)
  
Make Principle section labels in HeroFrame compress when possible, like Green Abilities
 Knockout's Major Twist sections compress too much for some reason...

Assign lwidth values to existing ExpandWindow calls

Assign width/buffer values to existing SelectWindow calls

Move buttons in HeroFrame to their own Frame (with its own geometry manager) so they quit resizing everything else's rows?
